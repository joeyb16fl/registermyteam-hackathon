Customer Experience

Admin Signup

Requires basic identifying fields, name of org, point of contact, all contact info, etc.
Signup gives a 14-day free trial for their organization.
During the free trial, or after they become a paying customer, they will add coaches to their organization.  The add feature asks only for their name, phone and email.
They will see a live list of all of the coaches.  
Eventually they will be able to click on the coach and see a hierarchy of all of the teams that coach has built, and all of the players that are on each of those teams.  There will also be a Pending list of players that have not been assigned to teams.

Coach Signup 

Occurs when they click the link the admin sent them.  Their name phone and email already are listed from the admin, but they do have the ability to edit them.
Coach then can Click Add a Team.  Names it.  (i.e. Offensive line, or Varsity Girls Basketball)
Coach then can create a “Cut List”.  Basically it will be 1st Cut, 2nd Cut, etc. until Final Cut.  
Coach then can assign a registered player into one of the cut lists.  Once the list is complete, the Coach clicks Finalize.  
Coach can write a template email for those that made a cut or missed a cut.  Each cut list has it’s own template email to be sent out.  Anyone not selected for the cut will receive an “missed the cut” automated email and those that are on the list receive the “made the cut” automated email.  

Athlete signup

Upon signup, the first question asks for their birthday. 

-If under 18, the athlete will finish the initial signup, but won’t activate profile (i.e. be able to fill out registration forms) until their parent links to their profile.  The parent will fill out their registration.

-If 18 or over, the athlete fills out their initial signup and can continue to their registration. They will see a search for their organization, and then a list of that organization’s coaches.  That links their profile to that team and receive that specific coach’s registration documents. 

Parent Signup

Parent signs up with initial signup.  
Enters athlete’s email address.  
Begins that athlete’s registration process.  Can choose to complete or save until later.
Returns to the parent’s profile with list of athletes they are the parent of.  
They may click on the current athletes name to continue with the registration OR click the Add button to add a new athlete.
